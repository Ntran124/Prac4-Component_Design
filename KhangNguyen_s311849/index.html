			<p> For internal students, it is very important to attend lectures.  Lecturers will generally give an overview of the day’s topic, relate it to previous topics, and indicate important points, readings, debates and issues for you to consider. This is where you can extend your understanding of the topic, become aware of the lecturer’s perspective and emphasis and make notes of the important aspects of the lecture. You need to prepare before you attend the lecture, pay attention during the lecture and revise the lecture content afterwards.</p>
